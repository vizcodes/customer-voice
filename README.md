# Customer Review Analysis Bot Using Large Language Models (LLMs)

## Project Overview

This mini-project leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze customer reviews for products listed on Walmart. Designed as a demonstration, the bot helps you understand how customers perceive a product by providing insights based on customer feedback.

## How Does It Work?

The bot is simple to use and requires only a product link from Walmart. Once you provide the link, the bot will:

1. **Scrape Reviews**: Collect customer reviews directly from the provided product link.
2. **Store Reviews as Documents**: Organize and save the reviews in a structured format.
3. **Uses RAG to retrive Documents** : For every questions you ask, it retrieves relevant documents and answers your question
4. **Interact with the Bot**: Ask questions to the bot to gain valuable insights into customer feedback.

Through these steps, the bot helps you quickly gather and analyze customer sentiment without needing manual review. 

## Example Questions You Can Ask

Once the reviews are collected, you can query the bot to extract key insights from customer feedback. Example questions include:

- **What are the main pain points customers are experiencing?**
- **What do customers like most about the product?**
- **Are there recurring themes or issues in the reviews?**
- **How does customer sentiment compare to similar products?**

These questions enable you to quickly understand customer satisfaction levels, identify potential areas of improvement, and highlight the product's key strengths.

## Who Would Benefit from This Project?

This tool is ideal for:

- **Customer Experience Analysts**: Quickly gather and analyze feedback to improve customer experience strategies.
- **Product Managers**: Obtain actionable insights for product development and enhancements.
- **Marketing Teams**: Identify positive aspects to highlight in marketing campaigns, as well as areas that may need addressing.
- **Customer Support Teams**: Gain a better understanding of common customer issues to proactively manage support.

With this bot, these teams can replace tedious manual review processes with an efficient, data-driven approach to understanding customer feedback.

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements for the bot include:

- **Support for Additional Platforms**: Expanding the bot’s capabilities to scrape reviews from other major e-commerce sites.
- **Sentiment Analysis and Topic Clustering**: Automatically group feedback into key topics and sentiment levels for a deeper understanding.
- **Enhanced Natural Language Understanding**: Improve the LLM’s ability to understand complex and nuanced queries for more precise insights.
